									<h3>Abstract</h3>
									<br>
									<p>In this lab, the Arduino IDE was configured to interact with the SparkFun RedBoard Artemis Nano and some of the features of the hardware were tested. A program was also written to have the onboard LED light up when the microphone detected a whistle. In addition to the Arduino IDE, a virtual machine was also configured for future use.</p>									
									<br>
									<h3>Part A: The Artemis Board</h3>
									<br>
									<p>The “Blink!” example was run and the LED was observed to blink as expected. The SVL baud rate did not need to be lowered from the default (921600 baud). The blinking LED can be seen in the video below.</p>

									</div>
									<br>
									<p>The code for “Example2_Serial” was downloaded to the board to verify that the serial port works. The video below shows the code being downloaded and then communication is done to and from the board in the serial monitor on the right half of the screen.</p>

									</div>
									<br>
									<p>The code for “Example4_analogRead” was downloaded to the board to ensure that the board was able to read analog input from the temperature sensor. The video below shows the analog data being read from the board. During this data collection, the Artemis board was held and breathed on to warm it up. It can be seen that the internal temperature measurement started around 27°C and increased to around 32°C.</p>

									</div>
									<br>
									<p>When the “Example1_MicrophoneOutput” code was initially run, the serial monitor printed a seemingly random collection of symbols indicating some sort of communication error. This bad output can be seen below.</p>
									<br>
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab01/bad_output_img.png" alt="" />
									<br>
									<p>To fix this issue, the baud rate on the serial monitor was adjusted to match that specified in the code (115200 baud). The desired output was then printed correctly. The changing loudest frequency value was observed when talking near the board and when loud vehicles would drive past the nearby window. The functionality of this code running on the hardware was further tested using a tone generator found online. This can be seen in the video below where it can be observed that the program detects a range of frequencies reasonably well.</p>

									<br>
									<p>By watching the Loudest Frequency value change while whistling was attempted, an approximate whistle frequency range was determined to be 750Hz to 1500Hz. The “Example1_MicrophoneOutput” code was slightly modified to light the LED when whistling was detected. This was accomplished by first adding the following line to the setup function to set the LED pin to be an output.</p>
									<pre><code>
pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output
									</code></pre>
									<p>Then in the function that prints the loudest frequency, before printing, the frequency is checked to see if it is in the whistle range, and if so, the LED is turned on and a message is printed indicating that a whistle was detected. Otherwise, the LED is turned off, and the normal message is printed. This was accomplished with the following lines of code:</p>
									<pre><code>
if(ui32LoudestFrequency>750 && ui32LoudestFrequency<1500) // if sound is in my whistle range
{
	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
	Serial.printf("Loudest frequency: %d    WHISTLE DETECTED\n", ui32LoudestFrequency);
}
else
{
	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
	Serial.printf("Loudest frequency: %d         \n", ui32LoudestFrequency);
									</code></pre>
									
									<p>The operation of this code can be seen in the video below. The video also shows that the Artemis board is operating with power from the battery instead of the USB cable.</p>

									<h3>Abstract</h3>
									<br>
									<p>In this lab, bluetooth communication was established between my computer and the artemis board. This came with a large number of challenges, and the host OS had to be used instead of the virtual machine. However, a connection was established, and data was able to be transferred.</p>									
									<br>
									<h3>Connecting to the Artemis Board</h3>
									<br>
									<p>The first few times main.py was run in the virtual machine the following error appeared:</p>									
									<br>
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab02/img/1.png" alt="" />
									<br>
									<p>Then, after unplugging and plugging back in the bluetooth adapter several times, the following error message was printed:</p>
									<br>
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab02/img/2.png" alt="" />
									<br>
									<p>The VM was restarted twice, the USB bluetooth adapter was moved to a different port on the PC, and the board was able to be found. In settings.py, the MAC address was added to Settings["cached"]. When this was done, and main.py was run again, the LED on the Artemis board would blink on and off indicating that a connection had been made.</p>
									<p>Around this point, the Artemis board began to act unresponsive after restarting and was found to be getting stuck on line 136 of the distributed Arduino sketch. This issue fixed itself some time later for no apparent reason, then began acting up the next day only to fix itself again.</p>
									<p>Additionally, at this point running main.py resulted in the following error message.</p>
									<br>
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab02/img/4.png" alt="" />
									<br>
									<p>This error could not be diagnosed, and the rest of the lab was done on the host machine (Windows 10).</p>
									<p>After downloading Python and Bleak on the host OS, main.py was run in the command prompt window. The following errors were found most times the script was run, but after several runs, the board connected. This inconsistency persisted through the rest of the lab.</p>
									<br>
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab02/img/5.png" alt="" />
									<br>
									<h3>Pinging the Robot</h3>
									<br>
									<p>In main.py, <code>pass</code> was commented out and <code>await theRobot.ping()</code> was uncommented. Then main.py was run and the output was observed in the terminal. The terminal displayed round trip times, about 850 of these recorded times were copied and can be seen in the histogram below.</p>
									<br>
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab02/img/6.png" alt="" />
									<br>
									<p>It can be seen that  the largest group of pings took around 100-105ms. The times ranged from 79.8 to 143.6ms and the average time was 101.25ms. The line <code>amdtpsSendData(m_Rcvd, l_Rcvd);</code> in the PING case shows that l_Rcvd is the length of the data being transmitted in the ping. The sketch was modified so that l_Rcvd would be printed in the serial monitor, and it was found to be 99. Therefore, the ping transfers 99 bytes. From this, it was calculated that on average the bluetooth transmission was about 15643 bits per second. This is significantly lower than the serial transmission used in this lab of 115200 baud (115200 bits/sec).</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Requesting a Float</h3>
									<br>
									<p>In main.py, <code>await theRobot.ping()</code> was commented out and <code>await theRobot.sendCommand(Commands.REQ_FLOAT)</code> was uncommented. Then the REQ_FLOAT case in the Arduino sketch was changed to the following:</p>
									<br>
									<pre><code>
case REQ_FLOAT:
	Serial.println("Going to send a float");
	//TODO: Put a float (perhaps pi) into a command response and send it.
	res_cmd->command_type = GIVE_FLOAT;     //set command type as GIVE_FLOAT
	res_cmd->length=6;                      //length doesn't matter since the handler will take care of this
	((float *)(res_cmd->data))[0] = 1.23f;  //put a float into data to send
	amdtpsSendData((uint8_t *)res_cmd, 6);  //2 bytes for type and length, 4 bytes of data
	break;
									</code></pre>
									<br>
									<p>When run, the terminal showed the following output:</p>
									<br>
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab02/img/7.png" alt="" />
									<br>
									<p>The float displayed on the screen didn’t exactly match the float that was sent (1.23). This shows that data transmission over bluetooth isn’t perfect, and if floats are to be compared, the comparisons may not be accurate if the data was transmitted over bluetooth.</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Testing the Data Rate</h3>
									<br>
									<p>To transmit data, the following code was added to the main loop in the arduino sketch:</p>
									<br>
									<pre><code>
if (bytestream_active)
{
	
	res_cmd->command_type = BYTESTREAM_TX;  //set command type to bytestream transmit
	res_cmd->length = 14;                    //length doesn't matter since the handler will take care of this
	//TODO: Put an example of a 32-bit integer and a 64-bit integer
	//for the stream. Be sure to add a corresponding case in the python program.
	//Serial.printf("Stream %d \n", bytestream_active);
	
	((uint32_t *)(res_cmd->data))[0] = 32;  //put a 32 bit integer into data to send (4 bytes)
	
	uint64_t num = 64;
	memcpy(res_cmd->data+4, &num, 8);       //put a 64 bit integer into data to send (8 bytes)


	// send a little data
	//amdtpsSendData((uint8_t *)res_cmd, 14);  //2 bytes for type and length, 12 bytes of data

	// send a lot of data
	uint64_t num2 = 65;
	memcpy(res_cmd->data+12, &num2, 8);       //put a 64 bit integer into data to send (8 bytes)
	uint64_t num3 = 66;
	memcpy(res_cmd->data+20, &num3, 8);       //put a 64 bit integer into data to send (8 bytes)
	uint64_t num4 = 67;
	memcpy(res_cmd->data+28, &num4, 8);       //put a 64 bit integer into data to send (8 bytes)
	uint64_t num5 = 68;
	memcpy(res_cmd->data+36, &num5, 8);       //put a 64 bit integer into data to send (8 bytes)
	uint64_t num6 = 69;
	memcpy(res_cmd->data+44, &num6, 6);       //put a 64 bit integer into data to send (8 bytes)     
	uint64_t num7 = 70;
	memcpy(res_cmd->data+52, &num7, 8);       //put a 64 bit integer into data to send (8 bytes)
	uint64_t num8 = 70;
	memcpy(res_cmd->data+60, &num8, 8);       //put a 64 bit integer into data to send (8 bytes)
	amdtpsSendData((uint8_t *)res_cmd, 70);  //2 bytes for type and length, 68 bytes of data
	
	//Print time
	unsigned long t = micros();
	Serial.printf("Package %d sent at %d us \n", pkg_count, t);
	pkg_count++;
}
									</code></pre>
									<br>
									<p>In addition to this code, bytestream_active was set to 1 in the START_BYTESTREAM_TX case, and pkg count was initialized as a global variable with a value of 0. As it appears, the above code transmits a byte stream of one 32-bit integer and eight 64-bit integers (70-byte command), but if the line under <code>// send a little data</code> is uncommented and the 15 lines under <code>// send a lot of data</code> are commented out, the code will instead only transmit one 32 bit integer and one 64 bit integers (14-byte command). This code also has the board serial print every time a package is sent along with the time that it was sent. </p>
									<br>
									<p>In main.py, <code>await theRobot.sendCommand(Commands.START_BYTESTREAM_TX)</code> was added to myRobotTasks and all other commands were commented out. Additionally the following lines were added to the simpleHandler function:</p>
									<br>
									<pre><code>
if (code == Commands.BYTESTREAM_TX.value):
	print(unpack("&lt;Iqqqqqqqq", data))   #unpacks 1 4-byte int and 8 8-byte int 
									</code></pre>
									<br>
									<p>The code above would print the package sent for the 70 byte command case. For the 14-byte case, <code>"&lt;Iq"</code> was used as the format string to indicate that data only includes one 4-byte number and one 8-byte number.</p>
									<br>
									<p>When the code was run for the 70-byte case, the output on the serial monitor and command line window looked like the following image.</p>
									<br>
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab02/img/out.png" alt="" />
									<br>
									<p>From testing the code for both package cases, the histograms below were made for the amount of time that passed between each package being sent.</p>
									<br>
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab02/img/8.png" alt="" />
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab02/img/9.png" alt="" />
									<br>
									<p>It can be seen that the largest amount of measurements of time was between 10.86 and 11.06ms for the smaller package, and between 11.14 and 11.34ms for the larger package. On average, the 14-byte packages were sent every 11.03ms and the 70-byte packages were sent every 11.16ms. This indicates that the larger packages sent slightly slower. For the 14-byte test, 932 packages were sent, but the terminal only printed 811 of them indicating that about 13% of them were dropped. For the 70-byte test, 904 packages were sent, but the terminal only printed 766 of them indicating that about 15% of them were dropped.</p>

									<h3>Abstract</h3>
									<br>
									<p>In this lab, several observations, measurements and calculations were made for both the physical remote control car and the simulated robot</p>							
									<br>
									<h3>Part A: Characterizing the Car</h3>
									<br>
									<p><u>Dimensions</u></p>
									<br>
									<p>Several dimensions were measured at least four times using a pair of digital callipers. The dimensions measured can be found in the image below.</p>
									<br>
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab03/img/dim.png" alt="" />
									<br>
									<p>The averaged measurements were:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Wheel Diameter: 77.4 mm</li>
										<li>Distance Between Axle Centers: 80.0 mm</li>
										<li>Width: 139.1 mm</li>
										<li>Length: 145.8 mm</li>
									</ul>
									<p>These dimensions may be useful when coming up with a model for the platform. The most useful dimension is most likely the wheel diameter which can be used to determine distance the car will travel per revolution as well as the tangential force that torque on the wheels will cause.</p>
									<br>
									<p><u>Backlash</u></p>
									<br>
									<p>The backlash of the gear train driving the wheels was measured by marking one of the little treads on one wheel with a pencil, and holding that wheel fixed so that the marked tread is the closest to the other wheel. Then the other wheel was turned as far as possible in one direction without straining the system. Then the tread on the turned wheel closest to the already marked tread was also marked. The turned wheel was then turned the opposite direction in a similar manner. From this position, the number of treads between the turning wheels starting and final position were counted. This is diagrammed in the figure below.</p>
									<br>
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab03/img/bl.png" alt="" />
									<br>
									<p>From the knowledge that each wheel has 92 little treads, it was calculated from 4 trials that the backlash is approximately 11.7 degrees. This measurement can only be seen as approximate because of the amount of play in the system and how easily the plastic bent. Knowing that this much backlash exists in the system will be useful since it will add some mechanical delay between the motor turning and the wheels turning.</p>
									<br>
									<p><u>Wheel Speed</u></p>
									<br>
									<p>The speed of the car’s wheels was measured using a slow-motion camera. This was done by securing the car in place, putting tape on one wheel, and comparing that piece of tape’s position to the position of a  stationary piece of tape. A computer with a stopwatch was also placed in the camera’s field of view. The setup for this test can be seen below.</p>
									<br>
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab03/img/speed_setup.png" alt="" />
									<br>
									<p>Slow-motion videos were recorded of both the right and left wheels spinning forward and backwards in both “speedy” and “slowly” modes. These videos can be seen below.</p>
									<br>
									<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
										<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kG6wfYmQjos" allowfullscreen></iframe>
									</div>
									<br>
									<p>The speed was calculated by using the stopwatch to find the time for the wheel to fully rotate 4 times and averaging the values calculated from two sets of rotations for each case. The rotations chosen were several seconds after the start, and several seconds before the stop of the control input to ensure that the spinning was steady-state. The spinning speed was found to be about 12.9 rev/s in “Slowly” mode and 14.4 rev/s in “Speedy” mode. Although the wheels will turn slower when actually moving the car due to friction and the added load of the car’s weight, this speed can be used to approximate the max speed the car could go.</p>
									<br>
									<p><u>Tricks and Performance</u></p>
									<br>
									<p>Having the car go at full speed in one direction, and then quickly switching the direction momentarily results in the car doing a forward roll as seen in the video below.</p>
									<br>
									<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
										<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jzS7eQ7KOkk" allowfullscreen></iframe>
									</div>
									<br>
									<p>The car was found to turn reasonably well around its center. The video below shows the car turning in a roughly 9 inch circle of electrical tape in both “speedy” and “slowly” modes.</p>
									<br>
									<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
										<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4GD8aLt4mY" allowfullscreen></iframe>
									</div>
									<br>
									<p>It can be seen that the car can stay in the circle for at least one or two rotations. It tended to drift off to the right, but upon further inspection of the floor, it was found to be slightly inclined. This test shows that an approximation of the car turning about its axis like a unicycle-robot model could be accurate.</p>
									<br>
									<p><u>Summary</u></p>
									<br>
									<p>The values measured and calculated are tabulated below.</p>
									<br>
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab03/img/sum.png" alt="" />
									<br>
									<h3>Part B: Characterizing the Virtual Robot</h3>
									<br>
									<p>All of the steps were followed to install software dependencies, set up the base code, start the simulator, and start the keyboard teleoperation tool. Only one small error was encountered. This error can be found in the picture below and was corrected by simply running the command given in the error message.</p>
									<br>
									<img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="Lab03/img/e1.png" alt="" />
									<br>
									<p>The teleop commands were used to move the robot around. This can be seen in the video below in which the speed is adjusted and the robot is driven around.</p>
									<br>
									<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
										<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cGGPTknislU" allowfullscreen></iframe>
									</div>
									<br>
									<p>The video shows the following aspects of the simulation environment:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>When the robot collides with a wall a warning triangle appears over the robot, and it stops moving</li>
										<li>Teleoperation works from the perspective view</li>
										<li>The robot could be dragged and dropped with the cursor</li>
										<li>when the robot is placed outside of the maze area and is driven out of the workspace, the workspace extends</li>
									</ul>
									<p>There didn't seem to be lower limits on the speed of the robot as the values could be changed to be arbitrarily small in the terminal and the robot would just move slower and slower. However, the robot seemed to have an upper limit on the linear and angular speed as the value could be increased in the terminal, but the robot would stop accelerating at a certain point. This max speed was measured using the video below in which the input speeds were made very large and the robot was driven straight and rotated.</p>
									<br>
									<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
										<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSlhdMmfAW0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
									</div>
									<br>
									<p>By looking at the robot pose and the clock at various times, the maximum linear speed was calculated to be 1 unit/sec and the maximum angular speed was calculated to be 90 deg/sec.</p>
